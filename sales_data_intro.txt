Project Description
The main objective of this project is to analyze and forecast sales using the provided sales data. The project involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting columns to appropriate data types, and removing duplicates.
Feature Engineering: Extracting additional features such as month, hour, and city from existing columns to enhance the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing sales data to uncover trends and patterns, including:
Monthly Sales
Sales by City
Sales by Hour
Sales Forecasting: Using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast future sales based on historical data.
By performing these steps, we aim to gain insights into the sales performance over time, identify the most profitable periods and locations, and predict future sales to aid in business planning and decision-making.
